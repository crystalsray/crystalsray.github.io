          <p>We hope that the bounding exercise informs your analysis of experimental data. As you have seen, the bounding exercise can provide interesting insights. There are several additional applications that you may be able to utilize to refine your bounds estimates and calculate sharper ranges of treatment control impacts. Please find relevant referenced below.</p>

      <p>Funding for this project was provided through a grant from Spencer Foundation. This website is designed to assist researchers interested in applying a principal stratification approach to their research questions. This tool intended for researchers who have a familiarity with the principal stratification approach. Researchers unfamiliar with the approach are encouraged to consult <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Principal_Stratification.pdf" target="_blank">Page <em>et al</em> 2015 </a>  before using this tool. </p>
