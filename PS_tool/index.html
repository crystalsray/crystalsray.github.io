          <h2>Calculating Bounds for Principal Causal Effects: Interactive Analysis Tool</h2>
          <p>This website is designed to assist researchers interested in applying a principal stratification approach to their research questions. This tool is intended for researchers who have a familiarity with the principal stratification approach. Researchers unfamiliar with the approach are encouraged to consult <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Principal_Stratification.pdf" target="_blank">Page <em>et al</em> 2015</a> before using this tool. </p>

          <h3>What is principal stratification?</h3>
          
          <p>With the proliferation of randomized trials in education, researchers are asking ever more sophisticated questions about program impacts. Collectively, the field is evolving from first-order questions about "what works overall" to more nuanced questions about what works, for whom, when, and under what circumstances. Although condition analyses based on pre-randomization characteristics in randomized control trials in education are commonly calculated, principal stratification allows researchers to answer questions related to post-randomization characteristics. Principal stratification provides a framework to specify conditions defined by the combination of experimental subjects' observed and counterfactual post-randomization actions or behaviors. For example, Feller et al. examined the impacts of Head Start on treatment students who would have otherwise enrolled at a non-Head Start childcare center versus children who were cared for in a home setting. Miratrix et. al. have also looked at how the impacts of Early College High Schools vary by the quality of the school lottery winners would have attended. For more information see <a> Miratrix <em>et al</em>.</a></p>

          <p>This tool illustrates how to calculate the bounds on principal strata of interest. The bounds identify the range of possible impacts on a particular post-randomization condition. While the calculations needed to solve for the bounds are relatively straightforward, researchers must make assumptions using scientific or substantive knowledge. This tool will guide you through the necessary framing, assumptions and calculations to estimate the bounds on groups of interest.</p>

            <li>Determine whether a principal stratification framework is appropriate for their data and research questions</li>
            <li>Calculate bounds for the casual effects of treatment within the specified strata </li>
