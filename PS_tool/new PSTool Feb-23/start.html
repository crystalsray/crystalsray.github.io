<title>Principal Stratification Tool</title>
<h1>Calculating Bounds for Principal Causal Effects: Interactive Analysis Tool</h1>
<div style="font-size:20px"> 
This website is designed to assist researchers interested in applying a principal stratification approach to their research questions. This tool is intended for researchers who have a familiarity with the principal stratification approach. Researchers unfamiliar with the approach are encouraged to consult 
<a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Principal_Stratification.pdf">Page et al 2015</a> before using this tool.

<h2>
What is principal stratification? <br> 
<br> 
</h2>
With the proliferation of randomized trials in education, researchers are asking ever more sophisticated questions about program impacts. Collectively, the field is evolving from first-order questions about "what works overall" to more nuanced questions about what works, for whom, when, and under what circumstances. Today, analyses that examine variation in treatment effects based on pre-randomization characteristics are common.  In contrast to examining variation in effects by such baseline characteristics, principal stratification allows researchers to answer questions related to post-randomization actions. More specifically, principal stratification provides a framework to specify subgroups defined by the combination of experimental subjects' observed and counterfactual post-randomization actions or behaviors. 
For example, <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/workshops/SSRN-id2534811.pdf">Feller et al 2016</a> examined the impacts of enrolling in Head Start on treatment students who would have otherwise enrolled at a non-Head Start childcare center versus children who would otherwise have been cared for in a home setting. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03139">Miratrix et al</a> have looked at how the impacts of Early College High Schools (ECHSs) vary by the quality of the school lottery winners would have attended absent the opportunity to enroll in an ECHS. For more information see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03139">Miratrix et al</a>.

This tool illustrates how to calculate the bounds for principal causal effects. The bounds identify the range of possible values of the principal causal effects that are consistent with the observed data. While the calculations needed to solve for the bounds are relatively straightforward, researchers must make assumptions using scientific or substantive knowledge to enable the process. This tool will guide you through the necessary framing, assumptions and calculations to estimate the bounds on Stratum-specific treatment effects.

With this website, researchers can <br><br>
a) Determine whether a principal stratification framework is appropriate for their data and research questions <br><br>
b) Calculate bounds for the casual effects of treatment within the specified strata
